This message (and some other "bind" combos) are sent using an external program developed by TEX_479.
The program primarily is a better chat for tf2. It's primarily designed to automatically translate the chatmessages.
But as you can see, there are some other neat features built into this tool.
Wanna get it yourself? Go to "https://github.com/TEX479/tf2-translator/" and install it from there.
